title: Tableau viz on how Americans spend their time
subtitle: Insights by age on social, family, and alone time (2009-2019)
---

This was a fun data visualization project with interesting insights. I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore how Americans spend their time across different life stages, using data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), 2009â€“2019. The chart plots average minutes spent per day (by age) on key activities: time spent alone, with children, with co-workers, with family, with friends, and with a partner. The visualization is fully interactive - when users hover over any point, they can see exact time spent on each activity at that age. <br/> 

Some key insights: time spent with co-workers peaks in early career years and then drops sharply post-65 (retirement). Time with children rises in the 30s, peaks around 40, then declines. Time spent alone gradually increases with age, becoming the dominant activity past age 70. Meanwhile, time spent with friends remains relatively flat across life stages. <br/> 

The project highlights important social and family patterns across life spans - useful for understanding social isolation, work-life balance, and aging trends in US.
