title: Modeling life expectancy and global health trends
subtitle: Statistical analysis and predictive modeling of life expectancy in R
---
This project involved statistical analysis and predictive modeling of life expectancy trends across 204 countries from 1960 to 2019, using a large Gapminder dataset and R. The work included extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression modeling. Key drivers of life expectancy identified were GDP per capita, fertility rate, region, and year. Results showed that life expectancy globally has been rising, with notable regional disparities - Europe and Americas consistently leading, while Africa lagged behind. <br/>
Other insights included China achieving a 75.9% increase in life expectancy, significant drops in Rwanda and Cambodia during periods of conflict, and a clear inverse relationship between fertility rate and life expectancy. The best predictive model achieved an RÂ² of 0.85, confirming the strong influence of economic and social factors on life expectancy.
