**Executive Summary.**
We built this project as part of our yearlong culminating project or capstone for Master's program. The Fundraiser Portfolio Scorecard Report is a Tableau dashboard and related documentation developed for the University of Washington's University Advancement team, a strategic fundraising unit that generated $668.7 million in FY 2023/24. Our project's core objective was to provide ~197 fundraisers with a centralized, visual tool for efficient and strategic portfolio monitoring. Our work was recognized with the 'Visionary Lens Award for Insightfulness' at the iSchool Capstone Showcase 2025.  <br/> <br/>
Problem & Solution: Fundraisers previously lacked a unified tool, leading to difficulties in tracking engagement, prioritizing outreach, and meeting performance goals. Our solution is an interactive Tableau dashboard that centralizes key portfolio insights, offers actionable data, supports pipeline management, and provides real-time visibility. <br/> <br/>
Approach & Deliverables: Our capstone team employed a user-centered design and agile analytics approach. This involved user research, wireframing, data warehouse exploration, SQL view creation, and dashboard prototyping. The key deliverable is the Tableau dashboard which consolidates metrics like contact history, qualification status, and giving activity, applying business logic to identify portfolio gaps and trends.
<br/> <br/>
Impact & Benefits: This solution is projected to save approximately 500 staff-hours weekly, replace disparate reports, highlight high-priority prospects, and suggest "Next Steps" for major gift officers. It will enable efficient stewardship of the $669 million annual pipeline and lay the groundwork for future AI insights. Ultimately, the scorecard empowers fundraisers to adopt a focused, data-informed approach. <br/> <br/>
Challenges & Learnings: Key challenges included data complexities, access delays, evolving scope, and eventually  user adoption across hundreds of different workflows. The project highlighted the importance of stakeholder alignment and the value of iterative design in addressing user pain points. Future efforts involve transitioning the prototype to a production version through testing, adding linking GUIDs, enhancing data-driven recommendations, piloting the product, and implementing a training and change management plan.
