title: The Ad-Tech Ecosystem
subtitle: Exploring the data infrastructure behind digital ads
---
My interest in this topic began at InMobi, where I worked on campaign analytics, programmatic ad strategies, and revenue optimization for global advertisers. This hands-on experience gave me a deep appreciation for the complexity of ad-tech systems and the importance of data infrastructure in delivering measurable business impact. This project reflects my ongoing curiosity about how technology and regulation shape the future of digital advertising. 

This project explores the advertising technology (ad-tech) sector - an ecosystem of data platforms, algorithms, and tools that power targeted digital marketing across the globe. The analysis covers the structure of the ad-tech value chain (advertisers, publishers, agencies, and platforms), key challenges like privacy regulations and fraud, and emerging trends such as advanced cloud infrastructure and AI-driven personalization. The report also highlights the critical role of data systems in optimization, real-time bidding, as well as audience segmentation.
