title: Kimball data warehouse for business intelligence system
subtitle: Store sales analysis with dimensional modeling, ELT, and Tableau dashboards
---
I signed up for this interesting and challenging project for my spring quarter 2024 course Business Intelligence Systems. First, we built a full Kimball data warehouse using Snowflakeâ€™s cloud architecture. The process started with gathering business requirements and designing a dimensional model (after comparing Kimball vs. Inmon approaches). We then built the ELT pipeline, extracting raw data, loading it into Snowflake, and transforming it into clean staging, dimension, and fact tables using SQL. It involved writing heavy SQL to create the necessary tables and views for the model and visualizations. Overall, we created and managed 50+ tables and views to build 4 Tableau dashboards. The final part was creating Tableau dashboards to answer key business questions. This project provided hands-on experience across the BI lifecycle: requirement gathering, data modeling, ELT, and visualization. It also reinforced how data governance and well-designed models drive better insights.
