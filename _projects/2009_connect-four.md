title: Helping Seattle residents coexist with urban coyotes 
subtitle: Designed an interactive platform to support human coyote coexistence 
---

<p>This project addressed the growing need for public education and behavior change around urban coyote encounters in Seattle neighborhoods. While urban coyotes are increasingly common, misconceptions and fear often drive unnecessary conflicts. The team designed an interactive digital platform, <strong>SeaCoyotee</strong>, to help residents—especially pet owners—coexist safely with coyotes through access to accurate, trusted information.</p>

<p>The platform features:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A curated FAQ based on expert sources (Project Coyote, Woodland Park Zoo)</li>
    <li>Real-time coyote sightings via data from <em>Carnivore Spotter</em></li>
    <li>Social updates integrated with platforms like Nextdoor</li>
    <li>An interactive quiz to reinforce learning</li>
</ul>

<p>The project followed an iterative human-centered design process, shaped by user interviews (with residents, parents, pet owners, conservation scientists), contextual inquiries, and multiple usability tests. Key insights showed that residents valued clear, region-specific advice, preferred real-time sighting updates, and wanted to debunk myths (such as exaggerated risks to pets). The intervention evolved through three prototype versions to better meet user needs—simplifying the interface, prioritizing verified sources, and removing unsustainable features.</p>

<p>The final design provides an accessible tool to reduce fear, correct misinformation, and encourage coexistence between Seattle residents and their wild coyote neighbors.</p>
