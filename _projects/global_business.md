title: Interactive Tableau story for global business indicators
subtitle: Parameter-driven country classification and GDP insights
---
This project involved building an interactive Tableau Story for analyzing key global indicators from the IMF World Indicators dataset. The primary objective was to explore economic and demographic trends across countries and to visually classify them as “developed” or “underdeveloped” based on dynamic GDP per capita thresholds. <br/> 

Overall, we created five interactive dashboards that allowed users to explore the data from multiple perspectives. One dashboard enables users to classify countries dynamically by adjusting the GDP per capita threshold. Interestingly, this feature made it possible to see which countries were on the cusp of development at different points in time. Another dashboard models the relationship between GDP and population, producing a strong linear relationship (R² = 0.91), helping users understand economic scaling across varying population sizes. Additional dashboards tracked trends in life expectancy, infant mortality, birth rates, and GDP over time, offering insight into both long-term development progress and areas needing attention. The focus of this project was parameter-driven visualization and exploratory data modeling. It provided a clear, intuitive way to identify key patterns and trends in global development and presented a compelling narrative through Tableau Story dashboards.
